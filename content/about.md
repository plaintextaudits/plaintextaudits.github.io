# Paco
Average RFC Enjoyer

I'm a software developer who's afraid of web browsers but feels deeply comfortable reading specs and tracing execution stacks.

I'm a bit of a people person as well, and I enjoy ~~evangelizing~~ mentoring fellow developers into better development practices.

I'll not shut up about Test Driven Development and ways to ensure code does what you expect.

# Doug
I can handle your math.

I'm passionate about code that's nice to read and work with. I will ducktape-fix your code if requested to (maniac laugh not optional).

May or may not draw inspiration from the arcane workings of Newton and the sort.
