# Paco

I've been a contributor at [alchemist](alchemist.wtf) for a lil while, I'm now
cobbling together a [bad frontend for Zora faucets](/zora-safe) as a
proof of concept for the council to pay staked MIST with it.

I got into the project by submitting an [audit for the new
AludelFactory](/static/aludel-factory-audit.md), and stayed implementing the
fixes 'cause they are just too chill.
